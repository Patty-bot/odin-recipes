    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This waffle recipe is the only one you'll need to make homemade waffles with your waffle iron. 
            Simple pantry ingredients mix up quickly in this easy batter that can be used right away or stored 
            in the refrigerator for up to a week. Serve waffles hot with whipped 
            cream and fresh fruit or with butter and maple syrup for either breakfast, brunch, or a snack.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs: This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
            <li>Milk: Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
        </ul>
